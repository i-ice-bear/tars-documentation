# Introduction
 
TARS Desktop. It is a portable computer, even more, smaller than a proper laptop, for the daily usage of computer geeks for normal tasks which include calculations, excel workloads, and other office loads. With the help of this desktop, we have a chance to facilitate the usage of computers among illiterate Indians, in India in the age of AI.
